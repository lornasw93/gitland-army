# Gitland Army

I originally completed this tech test March 2019 and after talking through my approach with the manager, I got offered and took the job as a .NET Developer. I've since restructured the code and instead of using .NET Core for the back-end, I'm now using Node.js. This is because the original API I was required to use no longer exists so in the back-end I've spun up what I could. My plan is to continue to work on it, gradually making improvements and adding better things to it. The original tech test is attached in this repo.
